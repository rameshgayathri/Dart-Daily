                                                              String Interpolation

String interpolation is the process of inserting variable values into placeholders in a string literal.
To concatenate strings in Dart, we can utilize string interpolation.
We use the ${} symbol to implement string interpolation in your code.


void main()
{
  String name = "Gayu";
  String message = "My name is $name";
  print(message);
  
  //To count the number of characters in a string
  print("The number of characters in the name $name is "+name.length.toString());
  
 int l=10;
 int b=5;
  
 print("The sum of the length and breadth is ${l+b}");
 print("The area of a rectangle with length $l and breadth $b is ${l*b}");
}
